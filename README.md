It is meant to be a combination of Web2 and Web3. We are only interested in finding parts of the Web that participants would want to be transparent. Not eveything needs to be anonymous or fully decentralised.

Price Discovery: This system provides a good way for price discovery. Customers themselves declare the price they are willing to pay for a product, which can give the seller a fair idea about the market demand and valuation for their product.

Potential for Better Deals: If there is less demand for a product, customers could potentially purchase products at a lower price than the market rate. Conversely, if the product is in high demand, sellers could get more than their initial asking price.

Decentralization and Transparency: As with other blockchain-based systems, this approach would offer transparency and immutability. Every offer would be visible to all participants, making the process fair and open.

Automation and Trustlessness: Smart contracts would automate the auction process, minimizing the need for intermediaries and eliminating the chances of manipulation or fraud.
